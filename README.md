The video used is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xML0q0-mYI&t=60, this video was used as the Musuem View video was not completed in time.

  - The last section of this page will be Three features which have been created by using Font Awesome to creat larger icons followed by some text to give a brief description of the feature. The Gallery was going to follow these however. I think this may have been two much information on one page so the gallery has its own page.

- __Gallery Page__

  - The gallery page allows the client to see a lot of images in a small place. Due to the nature of the project being HTML and CSS only I used a bootstrap to create the carousel. I then edited the code to include my own imgaes and also added a feature to show a title and small description of the image for users to see.
