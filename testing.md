## Testing

I have tested both HTML and CSS for all pages and shown the results below.

When completing the project I came across one major bug which was due to myself creating new workspaces each time i worked on the project this caused some issue when it came to working on latest versions, but this was resolved and corrected mid-way through the project.

Other issues I came across was when making the website responsive for mobile devices and other screens. I believe this issue came from using fixed heights and floats, I then removed the fixed height and used 'display:flex" instead of floats and the website become much more responsive.

I also had some legibility issues with the colour scheme I had chosen, I used [Color Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=977702&secondary.color=004793&secondary.text.color=92cc00) to find this out and then opted for a white colour text to make it more legible.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
