# Testing

I have tested both HTML and CSS for all pages and shown the results below.

When completing the project I came across one major bug which was due to myself creating new workspaces each time i worked on the project this caused some issue when it came to working on latest versions, but this was resolved and corrected mid-way through the project.

Other issues I came across was when making the website responsive for mobile devices and other screens. I believe this issue came from using fixed heights and floats, I then removed the fixed height and used 'display:flex" instead of floats and the website become much more responsive.

I also had some legibility issues with the colour scheme I had chosen, I used [Color Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=977702&secondary.color=004793&secondary.text.color=92cc00) to find this out and then opted for a white colour text to make it more legible.

### Responsiveness 
- Using Google Dev Tools to test the website or a range of devices using the ipad and pixel2 as the main marker i was able to get most items responsives, to tidy up any elements I then used some media queries based on two different screen widths to fix any other issues.


### Unfixed Bugs
- There is still a bug on the register page where the bullet points on the benefits section just show a standard bullet point and not an image of the museum. I have been unable to fix this issue. The bullet points did work but stopped unexpectedly
